# UsefulUtilities

I have planned to add the random utilities which i am going to create to make my everyday life easier.

I will also update the contents here when i keep adding more.

1) adbx:

I regularly use adb pull to copy files from my android device to my computer. Usually, after copying the files I will manually delete those files from the device. So, I have planned to merge these steps together in "adbx".
